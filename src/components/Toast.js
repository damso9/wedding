                I have pondered on the words which can fully encapsulate and
                deliver my feelings. If I could try, it would be excitement and
                serenity.

                The excitement of what the future holds-all the moments, the
                journeys, the growth, the highs and the lows. I look forward to
                savoring every bit of these.

                And the serenity that I have the best person at my side to go
                through all these together with. There's no person that I would
                want to through life's journey with-other than you.

                I am glad that God sent you to me, in the time that he did-God's
                time is truly the best. I have seen the immense love you give
                and feel honoured to be worthy of it. You are the very best. A
                virtous woman. Proof that, truly, God dey create!
